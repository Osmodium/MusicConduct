## Music Conduct
Music Conduct© is a small app that lets you set up rules for the music which is being played on your compuer.
It automatically hooks into Spotify™ and makes sure that the rules defined are being enforced.
In the rules area it is also possible to specify if you don't want to listen to tracks with explicit content and even make Music Conduct© remember tracks up to 24 hours ago and skip any that is being played again.
Note that all rules defined OR rules, which means that for a track to be played it needs to pass all the rules. If a track doesn't fulfill all the rules requrements, it will be skipped!

## Motivation
I was getting fed up with hearing the same tracks on radios/playlists from a specific artist or random live versions (which 99% of the time is a horrible version of the track with the crowd ruining most of the sound). #endrant
So I sat down and searched the Spotify™ forums for some way to completely "block" an artist, album or track, but no luck. They have had a bunch of requests like this, but it seems like they don't want to implement it (yet).
After a bit of searching, I found an app for OSX, which is called Denied (https://www.getdenied.com/) who actually did this!!! But only for OSX... Thanks for nothing! (Though I did buy it for my Mac Book Pro...)
I then decided to try my hand at creating one that takes the grest ideas from Denied and make an open source project for Windows.
